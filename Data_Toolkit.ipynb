        "> NumPy is a Python library for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large multidimensional arrays, matrices, and a collection of high-level mathematical functions. It is widely used because it is faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "> Broadcasting is a feature in NumPy that allows operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly replicating data, making computations more memory and time efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "> A DataFrame in Pandas is a 2-dimensional, size-mutable, and heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns), similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "> groupby() in Pandas is used to group data based on one or more keys and apply aggregation functions like sum, mean, etc., for easier data analysis.\n",
